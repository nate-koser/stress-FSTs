# FSTs for natural language stress patterns

I give some examples from my dissertation of how natural language stress patterns can be represented with FSTs and how to visualize them in Python. Defining stress patterns as FSTs allows us to connect them to the complexity hierarchy of formal language theoretic *functions*, which advances our knowledge of phonological theory and how these patterns may be learned.
